This project features a web page designed for showcasing a variety of vehicles, including motorcycles and cars. The page uses a minimalist design approach and is adaptable to different screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience across devices. The layout includes sections for key content, features, subscription, and footer.

## Project Structure

   - `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the page. It includes sections for hero content, features, video, subscription, and footer.

2. **CSS**:
   - `style.css`: The primary stylesheet that controls the design of the page. It includes styles for layout sections and responsive design adjustments for different devices.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - `app.js`: A JavaScript file intended for additional functionality and interactivity on the page. (Note: This file is not included in the current example.)


### Responsive Design
