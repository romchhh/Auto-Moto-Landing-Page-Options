2. **CSS**:
   - `style.css`: The primary stylesheet that controls the design of the page. It includes styles for layout sections and responsive design adjustments for different devices.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - `app.js`: A JavaScript file intended for additional functionality and interactivity on the page. (Note: This file is not included in the current example.)
