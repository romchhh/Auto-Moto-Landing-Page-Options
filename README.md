## Here is the first web-page option example:

This project features a web page designed for showcasing a variety of vehicles, including motorcycles and cars. The page uses a minimalist design approach and is adaptable to different screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience across devices. The layout includes sections for key content, features, subscription, and footer.

## Project Structure

1. **HTML**:
   - `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the page. It includes sections for hero content, features, video, subscription, and footer.

2. **CSS**:
   - `style.css`: The primary stylesheet that controls the design of the page. It includes styles for layout sections and responsive design adjustments for different devices.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - `app.js`: A JavaScript file intended for additional functionality and interactivity on the page. (Note: This file is not included in the current example.)


### Responsive Design

- **Mobile Devices (up to 768px)**: 
  - Adapts the layout for small screens with a column-based arrangement of elements.
  - Adjusts images and text for better readability and usability on mobile devices.

- **Widescreen Displays (1200px and above)**: 
  - Utilizes larger images and additional spacing for an enhanced viewing experience on larger screens.
  - Expands sections and buttons for improved accessibility and interaction.
